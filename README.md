#The Lizard Wizard's Shop
The Lizard Wizard’ Shop is a fun e-commerce website I have designed for a final project. It is a simple but a functional e-commerce website that has an fun, interactive frontend and simple but robust backend that every e-commerce website has. But the other websites won't be able to provide you with wizard gadgets and trinkets like The Lizard Wizard’s Shop does. 

## Stack
 The fronted(client) side consists of HTML, CSS, JavaScript for framework and Bootstrap for responsive design. For the backend(server) side I used Node js with Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose for cloud database and management, RESTful API for communication between front-end and back-end. 

##To Deploy
Before deploment, make sure you have installed node.js. After simply copy this repository and open with a code editor then go to terminal and split your terminal. For backend(server) go to the server directory on terminal and type 

### `node index.js`
After the backend is running go to the other terminal and type, 

### `install npm`
After this go to the client directory on your terminal and type,

### `npm start`
You should be able to see the website on localhost:3000.
